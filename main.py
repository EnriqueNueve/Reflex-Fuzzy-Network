Description: Python-3.7 implementation of the paper "A General Reflex Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network."
The General Reflex Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network is a supervised clustering algorithim.

I DO NOT CLAIM TO BE THE CREATOR OF THIS ALGORITHIM! I have no affilation
with the creation of the paper this code is based on.
For information about the creators of this algorithim and the paper that it is based on,
